                <p className="text-center pt-5">The world of the Bulls was unstableâ€”their grasslands withered into deserts just as quickly as their deserts bloomed into grasslands. In desperate need of a new, stable home, 5,000 Bulls boarded a spaceship and jettisoned off.</p>
                <p className="text-center pt-5">The Bulls were hopeful as they dreamed of expansion. However, fears arose as their shuttle started issuing alarms. With thrumming hearts they realized their fuel reserves were declining fast. With no other option, they landed on a nearby planet.</p>
                <p className="text-center pt-5">They were pessimistic as they surveyed the barren, rocky surface. Was this a sign their mission was fruitless? The absence of hope and direction ate away at them. They were lost.</p>
                <p className="text-center pt-5">However, The Bulls were determined and resilient. Picking up the pieces, they were able to call for a new ship and spent their time scouring maps of the universe deciding where to go next.</p>
                <p className="text-center pt-5">With their best chance of finding a home somewhere on the Ethereum blockchain, The Lost Bulls eagerly boarded their new spacecraft and resumed their search.  Where will they end up?</p>
